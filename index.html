<h1>About Dory Abeyta</h1>

  <p>I feel embarrassed writing about myself.
      Interactions with them me are often brief and awkward. A lot of people think that I am rude,
      or disinterested, but that is usually not the case. </p>
      <IMG src="cat3.png" alt="Cute cat">
     <p> I like cats and my personality is often
      compared to them; enigmatic, aloof, and picky. However, as is often the case with cats being misunderstood,
      these characterizations are usually only surface level when directed at me. With patience, I can open up and become
      more friendly and approachable.</p>
